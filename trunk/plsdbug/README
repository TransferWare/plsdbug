This is `PLSDBUG', a PL/SQL debugging package based on the External
Procedure Call toolkit (EPC). For more information see
www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware. 

PLSDBUG itself consists of the library, libplsdbug.la, an PLSDBUG server
and the headers installed in `/usr/local/include'. 

This package depends on the EPC toolkit and on the package DBUG (see
www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware). They should be installed
into the same lib and bin directories as PLSDBUG (e.g. use the same
prefix when installing).

DOCUMENTATION

- src/sql/dbug_trigger.html

INSTALLATION
============
Installation using the GNU build tools is described in INSTALL. 

Windows specific
================
For Windows platforms the Cygwin suite can be used. There is one caveat:
the libraries should not depend on the Cygwin DLL, but on the Microsoft
run-time DLLs instead. See the file BUGS in the DBUG distribution for
more information.

On Windows systems the environment variable ORACLE_HOME must be known to
the configure script. The value must have the following syntax:
<drive>:/<Oracle directory path>. Without this the value for ORACLE_HOME is
determined by the path to the PRO*C compiler which will result in
something like /cygdrive/<drive>/<Oracle directory>. This will confuse
the MinGW compiler.

An example for Windows:

./configure --prefix=c:/usr/local ORACLE_HOME="c:/oracle/ora81" CC="gcc -mno-cygwin"
